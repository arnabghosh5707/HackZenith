# BCREC Virtual Assistant 🤖

Welcome to the official repository of the **BCREC Virtual Assistant**—a smart, interactive web platform designed to help students, parents, and visitors navigate life at Dr. B.C. Roy Engineering College, Durgapur.

This isn't just a chatbot; it's a digital reception desk that handles everything from general inquiries to direct messages for the college admission cell.

## 🌟 What's Inside?

- **Smart Virtual Assistant**: A responsive AI-powered interface that answers common questions about departments, fees, placements, and campus life instantly.
- **Direct Inquiry System**: A unique conversational flow that lets you send your queries directly to the college office without needing an external mail client.
- **Dynamic Recruiter Marquee**: A live showcase of the major companies that actively recruit our talented students.
- **Modern Dashboard UI**: A clean, balanced layout that puts everything you need—contact info, college stats, and quick links—right at your fingertips.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and smoothness, even on mobile devices, by stripping away heavy blur effects in favor of a sleek, modern aesthetic.
